# Security Guide

Overseer is designed with **security-first principles**. This guide covers best practices for production deployment.

## Security Features

| Feature                | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **AES-256-GCM**        | All API keys and secrets encrypted at rest |
| **Bcrypt Auth**        | Password hashing with configurable rounds  |
| **Session Management** | Secure HTTP-only cookies with expiry       |
| **User Whitelisting**  | Only approved users can access bots        |
| **Command Detection**  | Dangerous operations require confirmation  |
| **Audit Logging**      | Complete action history                    |
| **Input Validation**   | All endpoints validated                    |
| **Rate Limiting**      | Protection against abuse                   |

## Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM:

```env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-char-hex-key  # openssl rand -hex 32
```

Encrypted data includes:

- LLM provider API keys
- Bot tokens (Telegram, Discord)
- Any custom secrets

## Command Safety

The agent automatically detects dangerous commands:

- `rm -rf /` and similar destructive operations
- `DROP DATABASE` and SQL destructive operations
- System-level commands that could compromise security

These commands require explicit user confirmation before execution.

<Warning>
  Never run Overseer as root. Create a dedicated user with minimal privileges.
