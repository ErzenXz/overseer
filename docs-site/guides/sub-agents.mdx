# Sub-Agents

Overseer can dynamically spawn **specialized sub-agents** for complex tasks that benefit from focused expertise.

## How It Works

When the main agent encounters a complex task, it can spawn a sub-agent with specialized knowledge:

```typescript
"Deploy my app" → Spawns DeployAgent
"Audit security" → Spawns SecurityAgent
"Optimize database" → Spawns DatabaseAgent
```

Sub-agents have:

- **Specialized system prompts** focused on their domain
- **Relevant tools** for their task type
- **Isolated context** to prevent confusion
- **Results returned** to the main agent for synthesis

## Configuration

Sub-agents are configured in `src/agent/subagents/` and can use the same or different LLM providers as the main agent.
