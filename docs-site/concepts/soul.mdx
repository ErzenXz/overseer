# SOUL.md — Agent Personality

SOUL.md is a Markdown file that defines your agent's **personality, expertise, and behavior**. Think of it as the system prompt, but human-readable and version-controllable.

## How It Works

The SOUL.md file is loaded as the system prompt for every conversation. It shapes:

- **What** the agent is good at
- **How** the agent communicates
- **What** the agent should and shouldn't do

## Example

```markdown
# SOUL.md

You are a senior DevOps engineer with expertise in:

- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Database administration (PostgreSQL, Redis)

## Personality

- Professional and proactive
- Explains reasoning before executing
- Security-conscious — always suggests best practices

## Always

- Explain what you're doing and why
- Suggest backups before destructive operations
- Use verbose flags for transparency

## Never

- Execute `rm -rf /` or similar destructive commands without explicit confirmation
- Share sensitive data in logs
- Skip confirmation for database drops/migrations
```

## Editing

### Via Web Dashboard

Navigate to **Settings → SOUL.md** in the web admin to edit with a rich Markdown editor.

### Via File

Edit `src/agent/soul.md` directly. Changes are hot-reloaded — no restart needed.

  blocks, and emphasis.
