# Tools

Overseer follows a **minimal built-in tools** philosophy — only essential tools are included, with extensibility via Skills and MCP for everything else.

## Built-in Tools

### File Operations

- **Read File** — Read file contents
- **Write File** — Create or update files
- **List Directory** — Browse filesystem

### Shell Execution

- **Execute Command** — Run shell commands with safety checks
- Dangerous commands require explicit confirmation
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Safety Features

All shell commands go through safety checks:

1. **Pattern Matching** — Known dangerous patterns (rm -rf /, etc.) are flagged
2. **Confirmation** — Flagged commands require user approval before execution
3. **Audit Logging** — Every command is logged with full context
4. **Whitelisting** — Optional command whitelist mode

## Custom Tools

Add custom tools in `src/agent/tools/`:

```typescript
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

export const myCustomTool = tool({
  description: "What this tool does",
  parameters: z.object({
    input: z.string().describe("Input parameter"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ input }) => {
    // Implementation
    return { success: true, result: "Done!" };
  },
});
```
